# Ekrem Teke

Hello, I'm Ekrem, a passionate software developer with a focus on web development and design. While I specialise primarily in front-end technologies, I have a solid understanding of back-end development as well.

My journey in tech began in 2022 when I completed an intensive one-year Full-Stack Web Development course with Code Your Future in Manchester. Following this, I expanded my skill-set through additional training with Prime Talent in AWS fundamentals and earned a Level-5 Full-Stack Development qualification from Gateshead College.
